For the first prototype we focused on the parts of the PCSS we will absolutely need for this project.
This includes the four fundamental parts of the project:
 - compression of folders to zip-archives and decompression of zip-archives to folders
 - test the submissions with the Java compiler to find errors and warnings
 - test the submissions with provided JUnit tests to get a list of all submissions that don't run correctly or as specified
 - send mails to later inform the students about the status of their submissions

All these parts have been successfully implemented and combined to build our first prototype.

Furthermore we delivered our product plan presentation.
